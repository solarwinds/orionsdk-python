# Orion SDK for Python

This project contains a python client for interacting with the SolarWinds Orion API

## API Documentation

For documentation about the SolarWinds Orion API, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK/wiki), [tools](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK/releases), and sample code (in languages other than Python) in the main [OrionSDK project](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK).

## Install

```
pip install orionsdk
```

## Usage

```python
import orionsdk

swis = orionsdk.SwisClient("server", "username", "password")

aliases = swis.invoke('Metadata.Entity', 'GetAliases', 'SELECT B.Caption FROM Orion.Nodes B')

print(aliases)
```

## SSL Certificate Verification

Initial support for SSL certificate valuation was added in 0.0.4. To
enable this, you will need to save the self-signed cert to a file. One
way of doing this is with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect server:17778
```

Then add an entry to your hosts file for ``SolarWinds-Orion`` and you
will be able to verify via doing the following:

```python
import orionsdk
swis = orionsdk.SwisClient("SolarWinds-Orion", "username", "password", verify="server.pem")
swis.query("SELECT NodeID from Orion.Nodes")
```

## Setting Timeout

```python
import orionsdk
import requests

session = requests.Session()
session.timeout = 30 # Set your timeout in seconds
swis = orionsdk.SwisClient("SolarWinds-Orion", "username", "password", verify="server.pem", session=session)
swis.query("SELECT NodeID from Orion.Nodes")
```

## Setting Retry 

```python
import orionsdk
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry


def retry_session(retries=3,
                  backoff_factor=0.3,
                  status_forcelist=(500, 502, 504)):
    session = requests.Session()
    retry = Retry(
        total=retries,
        read=retries,
        connect=retries,
        backoff_factor=backoff_factor,
        status_forcelist=status_forcelist)
    adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry)
    session.mount('http://', adapter)
    session.mount('https://', adapter)
    return session


swis = orionsdk.SwisClient(
    "SolarWinds-Orion",
    "username",
    "password",
    verify="server.pem",
    session=retry_session())
swis.query("SELECT NodeID from Orion.Nodes")
```
